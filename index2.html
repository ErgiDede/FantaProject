				<h2>About <span> Fanta!</span></h2>
				<p>
					Fanta started back in the World War II days when a trading ban was placed on Germany by the Allies.
					The Coca-Cola Company wasn’t able to import the syrup needed to produce Coca-Cola in Germany.
					Dr Schetelig decided to create a new product for the German market instead of Coca-Cola which could be made using only ingredients available in Germany which at the time was mainly apple fiber and a by-product of cheese.
					It tasted of orange and was yellow colored.
					The name Fanta comes from ‘fantasie’ which is German for ‘imagination’.
					And obviously the creator needed a good imagination to think that cheese and apple would make a good drink.
					The name was chosen by a salesman called Joe Knipp.
					The Coca-Cola Company liked this name and decided that’s its name.
					Fanta was the second drink to be produced by Coca-Cola, the first being the original Coca-Cola.
					Fanta Orange is the most popular flavor and it’s available in 180 different countries.
					Also there are over 70 flavors worldwide.
